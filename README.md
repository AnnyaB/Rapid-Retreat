Overview
Simple Game is a basic 2D game developed in Java using the Swing framework. The objective of the game is to control a blue square (the player) using the arrow keys and avoid colliding with randomly spawning red circles (enemies). If the player collides with an enemy, the game ends, and a "Game Over!" message is displayed.

## Features

Player Movement: Control the player using the arrow keys.
Random Enemy Spawning: Enemies spawn randomly on the screen and move randomly within the game area.
Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the player and enemies, ending the game if a collision occurs.
Simple Graphics: The game features a straightforward graphical interface with basic shapes.
